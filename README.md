# Data Structure and Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains a collection of various Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) implementations in **C++** and **Python**. It includes commonly used data structures, sorting algorithms, and other algorithmic solutions. The aim of this repository is to provide clear and efficient implementations to help both beginners and intermediate programmers learn and understand DSA concepts.

## Data Structures

### Binary Search Tree
- A binary tree in which each node has at most two children, and for each node, all elements in the left subtree are smaller, and all elements in the right subtree are larger.

### Linked List
- A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next one.

### Queue
- A linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

### Doubly Linked List
- A type of linked list where each node has pointers to both the next and previous elements.

### Hash Table
- A data structure that stores key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
- A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

### Selection Sort
- An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

### Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted list one item at a time by repeatedly inserting the next element into the correct position.

### Merge Sort
- A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into smaller parts and then merges them back in sorted order.

### Quick Sort
- A comparison-based sorting algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

### Heap Sort
- Based on a binary heap data structure, it converts the array into a heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element.

## Search Algorithms

### Linear Search
- A simple search algorithm that checks each element of the list sequentially.

### Binary Search
- A search algorithm that divides the list in half at each step, reducing the problem size significantly. Works on sorted lists only.
